# ArduinoCODES
This repository is a collection of my Arduino learning projects. Each version (Vol 0.1 → Vol-) shows my progress in electronics and coding — starting from blinking LEDs, moving into sensors, displays, radar systems, and stepper motor control. My goal is to document my journey and build a foundation for future robotics and engineering projects.

⚡Vol 0.1 – my1starduino_may24_vol_0.1.ino

My very first Arduino project.

Blinking three LEDs in sequence.


⚡ Vol 0.2 – ledchaser_may26_vol_0.2.ino

LED chaser effect.

LEDs light up in a chasing/pattern style.


⚡ Vol 0.3 – distancesensor_may28a_vol_0.3.ino

Ultrasonic distance sensor project.
Has alert system using buzzer and red LED
Measures and displays distance values.


⚡ Vol 0.4 – radar_180degrees_jun6_vol0.4.pde + radarsonar180degrees_jun6_vol_0.4.ino

First version of Radar Sonar (180°).

Servo motor sweeps ultrasonic sensor to scan in half-circle range.


⚡ Vol 0.5 – lcddisplay_july3_vol_0.5.ino

LCD Display integration.

Displays output values on an LCD screen.


⚡ Vol 0.6 – radardetection_july29_vol_0.6.ino

Combination of distance sensor and radar sonar.
Servo scans in 180 degrees and has alert system.
Displays detected objects and their distance in radar format.


⚡ Vol 0.7 – steppermotor_28byj-48_aug22_vol0.7.ino OR steppermotor_28byj-48_2ndversion_aug22_vol0.7.ino

Experiments with Stepper Motor (28BYJ-48).

Controls precise rotation for future radar/robotics projects.
