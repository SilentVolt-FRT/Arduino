# ArduinoCODES
This repository is a collection of my Arduino learning projects. Each version (Vol 0.1 → Vol-) shows my progress in electronics and coding — starting from blinking LEDs, moving into sensors, displays, radar systems, and stepper motor control. My goal is to document my journey and build a foundation for future robotics and engineering projects.
